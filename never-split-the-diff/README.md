## Rough Notes

### Labeling
Labeling is when you say "It seems like...", "It sounds like...".
Basically, label the emotions that the person is going through.

### Fair word

#### Negative usages and responses

*Usage: Peddlerish*
> It doesn't seem fair... 

> I apologize. Let's go back to the beginning where I was unfair and start from there.

*Usage: Sharp*
> You have received a fair deal.

> Fair...? It seems like you are ready to show the books to prove your claim.

#### Positive usage

> I want to be fair in this exchange and if at any point you feel things are unfair, feel free to stop me and we can discuss it.
