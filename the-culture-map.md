# The Culture Map

### by Erin Meyer (INSEAD prof)

1. Communicating: Low-Context versus High-Context

> Tell them what you are going to tell them; then tell them; then tell them what you've told them.

High-context share longer communal history.

Ask open clarifying questions repeatedly and read body language.

2. Evaluating: Direct Negative Feedback versus Indirect Negative Feedback

Use deprecating humor to diffuse any misunderstanding.

3. Persuading: Principles-First versus Applications-First

Asian cultures have holistic thought patterns versus Westerners have specific thinking.

4. Leading: Egalitarian versus Hierarchical

Power distance

5. Deciding: Consensual versus top-down

Use positive words to describe other culture and self-deprecating humor on self.

Japan's ringi system.

6. Trusting: Task-based versus Relationship-based

Cognitive trust and affective trust

7. Disagreeing: Confrontational versus Avoids confrontation

> If you don't know what your behaviors signify, you'll have no control over the signals you send, and the results can be disastrous.

8. Scheduling: Linear-time versus Flexible-time
