## Rough Notes

### Labeling
Labeling is when you say "It seems like...", "It sounds like...".
Basically, label the emotions that the person is going through.

## Getting to "No" ASAP
Is now a bad time to talk for a few (~n) mins?
How you given up on this?
Do you want this project to fail?

### Fair word

#### Negative usages and responses

*Usage: Peddlerish*
> It doesn't seem fair... 

> I apologize. Let's go back to the beginning where I was unfair and start from there.

*Usage: Sharp*
> You have received a fair deal.

> Fair...? It seems like you are ready to show the books to prove your claim.

#### Positive usage

> I want to be fair in this exchange and if at any point you feel things are unfair, feel free to stop me and we can discuss it.

## Never split the difference

Never hide your timelines or deadlines.
Leverage it both ways.

Walk away.

Don't meet in the middle.

Never compromise. It's easy and not valuable.

## Bending Reality

Ensure that there is something to lose if they don't take it.

## Giving Control

> How am I supposed to do that?

Use the following words **only**
- How?
- What?

Regulate your emotions. This is key.

Japanese businessmen use translators, even if they know English to enable them to pause and think.
